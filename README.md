## What is Blockchain Based CIDS?

Collavorative intrusion detection systems (CIDS) are developed to allow single IDS nodes to exchange signatures and alerts for performance improvement reasons. CIDSs combine the knowledge of different IDSs and improve the accuracy of attack detection. These systems still have major challenges such as authenticity and maintaining trust. Combining blockchain with CIDS is proposed to overcome these challenges. 

Our blockchain based CIDS system is a web application where single IDSs can add suspicious signatures using smart contracts and vote for the signatures based on the result of their ML-based IDSs.
